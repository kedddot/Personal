                <strong>Happy Valentines Day!</strong> depending on our plan, this may either come late or early, maybe even on 14 itself. It's been 16 months Tei, i'll be honest it still feels like we were together just a few months ago but were already 16 months old together!
                <br><br>I just wanna say that I appreciate your time and effort that you've put into our relationship. Thank you for the patience that you have for me when I get too much hehe.
                <br><br>I chose this kind of message this year! I wanted to be unpredictable kasi last year's valentines and nung new year it was an email and on your birthday I gave you a hand written letter with a worn out, antique paper.
                so this year I decided to make a website since we also had plans of making a wiki-like website of us, so this kinda serves like that!
                <br><br>That aside, I also want to say that I am proud of how we've grown to each other. Times like these we barely get to spend time together but we still somehow find a way to entertain each other. I'm sorry for the doubts i've given us and the multiple sorry ive wasted.
                <br><br>Thats almost all I want to say! yes this is the "person" project ive been doing and it has been by far my biggest, most taught out, and favourite project so far!
                <br><br>I hope this stays as a memory project cause im not really sure where to put these files but ill find a way! but that's not that important. The important thing is you'd be able receive and see this website / project.
                <br><br>Thaks again for the time and effort you've put up with me these months! I love youu Teii! 
                <br><br><span class="right">Yours truly, Keii</span>
